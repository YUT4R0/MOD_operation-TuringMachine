# TURING MACHINE: MOD operation simulator
- This script basically simulates a simple # (a mod b = n), where 'a', 'b' and 'n' are integers represented by 'I' and 'mod' by '#'.

If you type something for example: 'III#II', you get "III#II=I ACCEPT" as a result, otherwise if you type invalid symbols you get "REJECT"
